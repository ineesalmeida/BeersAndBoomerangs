                    <p>
                        We do not collect any kind of personal data. We do not ask our players to provide personal data,
                        nor do we use any third-party tools to determine this whatsoever. While the game engines we use
                        may
                        offer personal data services, we do not use them.

                    <h2>Unity Engine</h2>
                    <p>
                        For our game, we use the Unity engine as our development platform and Unity Analytics to
                        determine
                        the performance of players of our games.

                        Third-Party privacy policy of Unity (https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy)

                        This includes – how well the games go, how long they take, and what kind of pre-game set-up is
                        used.
                        None of this information can ever be matched to a specific user.

                        To speed up our development of games, we have opted to use game engines. One of these is the
                        Unity
                        Engine, and we use this for our VR game releases. This game engine requires technical data about
                        the
                        player’s device to work, which includes the manufacturer, hardware components, device and
                        network
                        identifiers and the system language. This technical data is sent to Unity and accumulated in
                        statistics, which are publicly available. The game or our company has no control over how Unity
                        uses
                        such information, yet it is also anonymous.
